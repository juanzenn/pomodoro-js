# Pomodoro
Pomodoro app for tracking **productivity and time used** studying/working.

[live version](https://juanzenn.github.io/pomodoro-js/)

## What is a pomodoro?
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

## Features
* Click the button and the countdown will start, after 25 minutes, the timer will stop.
* Store your pomodoro's count in localStorage.

*Dead simple.*

### Why? 
This app was created for working with **Date()** Javascript Object.

Here is a list of features I want to implment in the future:
* A **pause** button.
* Variable timing (up to 59min of pomodoro and down to 10min).
* **Auto-start** for short period of rest (5min).
* **Users** for more flexible data-storage add stats.

Feel free to add a pull request if you want to help with the implementation of this features.
