# Pomodoro
Pomodoro app for tracking **productivity and time used** studying/working.

## What is a pomodoro?
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.[1] The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

## Features
* This is a simple app. Click the button and the countdown will start, after 25 minutes, the timer will stop.
* This app store your pomodoro's count in localStorage

### Why? 
This app was created for practice with the Date() Javascript object. I'll be adding:
* A **pause** button
* Variable timing (up to 59min of pomodoro and down to 10min)
* **Checkbox for auto-start a short period of rest (5min)**

Feel free to add a pull request if you want to help with the implementation of this features.
